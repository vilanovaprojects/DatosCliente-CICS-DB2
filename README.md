# DatosCliente-CICS-DB2

### Requirements

- Mainframe with OS/390 (V2R10).
- Terminal 3270 (WX3270).
- COBOL.
- DB2 (Version 6).
- CICS (Version 5.3.0).

### Installation
- Prepare database with SPUFI, use the following order : (SPUFI1, SPUFI2, SPUFI3).

- Create DCLGEN with the previously created database (USRDATOS).
- Compile the menu maps with the JCL compiler (COMPIMAP).
  - Enter with "view" and aply the changes "C XXXXXX MENU0X ALL" before submited.
- Compile cobol program with the JCL compilar (CCICSDB2).
- Installation in CICS:
     - Define maps with CEDA
          - MENU00  -->  CEDA DEF MAP(MENU00) GROUP(DATOS)
          - MENU01  -->  CEDA DEF MAP(MENU01) GROUP(DATOS)
          - MENU02  -->  CEDA DEF MAP(MENU02) GROUP(DATOS)
          - MENU03  -->  CEDA DEF MAP(MENU03) GROUP(DATOS)
		  
     - Define program -->  CEDA DEF PROG(DATOS) GROUP(DATOS)
     - Define transaction -->  CEDA DEF TRANS(DATO) GROUP(DATOS)
	 
	 - Finally we have to associate the transaction to the program. Clear screeen with the "Pause" key and execute the transaction by typing "DATO" on terminal.


### Introduction

This is a CICS program executable with 3 different menus on witch we can insert, search and list the records. The records are saved in the DB2 databse that we sholud have connected to CICS. It is programed in COBOL in pseudoconversational mode so it is a good practice to program as in a real work enviroment. The program is typed in Spanish, but I hope it won't be a problem, in any case dont hesitate to contact me ;)

New registration screen. The variables have been previously declared with "NOT NULL" so it will report an error if the fields are not filled in. It will also report duplicate registration in the CIF. Finally pressing F3 will exit to the main menu.

		 Search record
